The Big Five Personality Traits Model measures five key dimensions of people's personalities:

 
1. Openness: sometimes called "Intellect" or "Imagination," this measures your level of creativity, and your 
desire for knowledge and new experiences. 

2. Conscientiousness: this looks at the level of care that you take in your life and work. If you score highly in 
conscientiousness, you'll likely be organized and thorough, and know how to make plans and follow them 
through. If you score low, you'll likely be lax and disorganized. 

3. Extraversion/Introversion: this dimension measures your level of sociability. Are you outgoing or quiet, 
for instance? Do you draw energy from a crowd, or do you find it difficult to work and communicate with 
other people? 

4. Agreeableness: this dimension measures how well you get on with other people. Are you considerate, 
helpful and willing to compromise? Or do you tend to put your needs before others'? 

5. Natural Reactions: sometimes called "Emotional Stability" or "Neuroticism," this measure emotional 
reactions. Do you react negatively or calmly to bad news? Do you worry obsessively about small details, or 
are you relaxed in stressful situations?
