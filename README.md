Internship based assignment
This project is about Support vector Machine and its Application.In 
this Application we did Digit recognition using Sklearn Library in Python. 
SVM classifier is used as the training algorithm and then tested it on 
MNIST dataset. We achieved a training accuracy of 98.05% and a test accuracy 
of 97.83% demonstrating that the proposed method can achieve significant and 
promising performance in digit recognition. Then we implemented our model to 
recognize user given handwritten digits in real time.SVM has Some kernel 
function .In this digit recognition we use radic basis Function . Radial basis 
function is typically the best option (RBF). Currently, the proper kernel function 
is chosen using the cross validation method.
